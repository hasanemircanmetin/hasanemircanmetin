<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
<p>
I am enthusiastic about games since I was a child. One day a question popped to my head. I was playing these for so long but I didn't have any idea how they were being made. Since that day, I dived too deep into games that I haven't been able to get out (not that I want to get out :) ) and my passion about games have been growing since. <br><br>


Been playing games since I was 2.5.<br>
Developed my first game when I was 12.<br>
Published my first game when I was 18.<br>
